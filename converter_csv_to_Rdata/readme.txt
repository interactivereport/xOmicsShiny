xOmicsShiny_ConvertCSV2Rdata.R can be used to convert four csv files into 2 Rdata results, which can be uploaded to the Shiny app directly.

The example dataset is available at:
https://xomicsshiny.bxgenomics.com/RNA_Seq_Demo.zip

After unzipping the folder, you will see the following four files:
Mouse_Microglia_Comparison_Data.csv
Mouse_Microglia_Exp_data.csv
Mouse_Microglia_ProteinGeneName_Optional.csv
Mouse_Microglia_Sample_metadata.csv

Users can then add the xOmicsShiny_ConvertCSV2Rdata.R to the folder, and run the script using RStudio.
