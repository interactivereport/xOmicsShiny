# Monotonic Trend Module

This module enables users to check if the dose-response/time-course effect is monotonic or not. 

## Fitting Curve

This functionality showed dose-response/time-course plot with linear fitting for individual genes. It contains 3 sub-tabs.

### Fitting Curve

The "Fitting Curve" tab shows the dose response plots.The example below shows that all 3 plots has very low R-square value, which indicate bad fit.

It is very clear that the respone keeps up and down when we change to view "Connecting Dot".

### Result Table and Data Table

The "Result Table" shows the fitted results in a searchable table, which are shown as labels in the plots. And the "Data Table" shows the original data of the selected genes.

## Result Table (all)

This tab shows the fitted results in a searchable table for all the genes. User can apply filter condition to view the results for the filtered genes only.

## Browsing

This tab allow user to view the fitting plots from previous filtered gene list.
