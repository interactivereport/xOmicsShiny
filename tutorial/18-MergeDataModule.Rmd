# Comparison Result Merging Module

This module enable users to combine multi-omics data analysis results at the comparison level (i.e., the differential expression analysis result). This function is designed for the users when they have different datasets from the same or similar study and would like to navigate them together. However, unlike other tools such as [MOFA](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20178124){target="_blank"}, our tool does not integrate the datasets at the raw data level. Users need to process the data and acquire differential expression comparison results before using xOmicsShiny.

After merging the comparison results, users can visualize the data using many functions that described previously in the tutorial, such as the aforementioned DEG visualization in **Chapter \@ref(deg-module)**, and pathway enrichment analysis in **Chapter \@ref(gene-set-enrichment-module)**, etc.

## Merge Comparisons

The comparisons in the pre-loaded datasets can be merged using one of four methods: union, overlap (intersect), distinct, and simple append. Depending on the chosen method, users need to set the **Overlapped Datasets** cutoff to retain only the genes that appear in a number of comparisons equal or greater than the cutoff. If the merging process involves the same gene from different comparisons, we offer four methods for merging p-values: Fisher (χ²-based method), minP (minimum p-value), Simes (uses ordered p-values to determine significance), and Stouffer (applies the inverse standard normal cumulative distribution function to p-values). Additionally, there are three methods for merging fold change values: average, multiplication, and formula (a linear combination of the fold changes).

## Data Source

This tab shows a merged table of merged data set and original datasets.

The merged data set can be analyzed using other comparison visualization tool. The example below shows the GSEA analysis result tables for the merged data set.
