# Heatmap Module

This module generates highly customized publication-quality heatmaps with the ComplexHeatmap package in R. Users can enter automated list of differentially expressed genes or enter a custom list of genes to highlight on the heatmap. This module differs from other modules in that each time Users change the attributes; they need to click on the “Plot/Refresh” button to generate the plot. This is to avoid changing the output before all the attribute are added.

## Static Heatmap Layout 1

The “Static Heatmap Layout 1” uses the ComplexHeatmap package (Gu et al., 2016) for generating the plot. For demo purposes, we have selected options that highlight some capabilities to generate informative heatmap. For gene selection the default option is the selection of 100 random genes which can also be changed to variable genes. Here we selected DEGs/DEPs from the **RNAseq_HFvsCD_old** comparison. Users also have the option to change the cutoff criteria for filtering the genes. They can also add/remove annotation categories for the samples on the columns.

In this heatmap, the top up-regulated genes in **Old_HF** samples are seen as high in Old_HF samples only, while the top up-regulated genes in the **Young_CD** samples are also high in the **Old_CD** or **Young_HF** samples. This pattern suggests that both Age_Group and Treatment has some effect on gene expression, and they showed interactive effect on gene expression too.

## Static Heatmap Layout 2

The “Static Heatmap Layout 2” uses the heatmap.2 function from the gplots package for generating the plot. Here is a demo of the same set of genes with dendrograms for both rows and columns.

## Interactive Heatmap

The "Interactive Heatmap" uses Plotly for generating the plot. Users can check the detailed data information by mouse-over the data point in the heatmap. THe heatmap can be zoomed using the function buttons located at the upper-right corner of the plot area.
